# ðŸŽ¬ Crims Subtitle Merger

A simple Python script that merges multiple subtitle tracks from `.mp4` video files into a single `.srt` file.

Specifically built for episodes of *CrÃ­menes* (TV3), where:
- **Track 0:3** contains **Spanish subtitles for Catalan speech**
- **Track 0:4** contains **Catalan subtitles for the full episode**

The script merges these into a single `.srt`:
- Keeps Spanish subtitles from Track 0:3
- Fills in missing dialogue using Catalan subs from Track 0:4
- Outputs a clean `.srt` file in **Spanish only**
